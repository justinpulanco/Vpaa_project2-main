# ✅ Django Admin Fixed!

## What Was Wrong:
- Python 3.14 + Django 4.2 compatibility issue
- Django 4.2 doesn't fully support Python 3.14

## What I Did:
✅ Upgraded Django from 4.2.26 to 5.2.9
✅ Django 5.2.9 is compatible with Python 3.14
✅ Ran migrations

## Now Restart Backend:

**Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and run:**
```bash
cd vpaasystem
python manage.py runserver
```

## Then Access Admin:

**URL:** http://localhost:8000/admin/
**Username:** justin
**Password:** Justinjames23311

## Should Work Now! 🎉

The error is fixed. Just restart the backend server and you can access Django admin!
